# py_util: Personal Python Programming Exercise
This is a set of utility files that I've been working on since 2016 or so, mostly as practice exercises to work through new topics I've been learning in Python.

You're welcome to poke through them, but I make absolutely no guarantees regarding their security, efficiency or pythonicity.
